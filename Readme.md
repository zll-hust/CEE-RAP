# CEE-RAP

The repo records the list of faculty members holding Research Assistant Professor (RAP) or similar positions in the Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) departments of the US News Top 20 Engineering Schools. It includes links to their homepages and the number of publications on Google Scholar. Since it's unclear whether some positions are equivalent to RAP, the list is relatively long and requires further verification. Many Professors of Practice do not have Google Scholar or ResearchGate profiles, so their publications are not included. I hope this repo can benefit your academic career!

该仓库记录了US News Top20 Engineering School CEE专业的RAP和类似教职的faculty人员名单，包括个人主页链接和google scholar论文数量。由于一些教职不确定是否与RAP类似，人员名单较长，需要核实是否可以列入。很多professor of practice没有google scholar或research gate，无法确定论文数量，所以没填入。
